# EHA---Desktop-Stock-Application
A Desktop application written in JavaFX. 

### EHA Supplement Stock Control System

### Description:
This is a desktop application that I wrote by myself using Java. I also submitted this as my final year computer science project .
It uses a local database, and syncs automatically in the
background to an external database. 
The System was developed with a fictional client in mind, but it was developed according to specifications and requirements provided by the university. I tried to design and implement the system in a way that would help to easily replace the “paper-based” system at a conventional small business, and at
the same time aid and enhance business goals. The system was built with ease of use in mind. Therefore the look and feel, and also the
navigation between components, reflects this ideology. I tried to take as much responsibility as possible away from the user, so that the user can make use of the technology to be productive, and not waste time.

### Technologies used:
Using an MVC design opattern, Java - JavaFX, with Maven as dependancy library
management, I used open source apache PDF Box to create pdf reports. I Integrated JUnit for unit tests. Netbeans was used as an 
IDE. I used GIT as version control system. I Used the MAMP
stack for apache server and MySql database to implement a dev/test environment. Also used
WAMP server for the windows 7 implementation. Open-source software
SymmetricDS(Java-based) was used for database sync.
